#Assignement Explaination as follows:

#This assignement dives in assessment of monthly time series data for Airline Passenger. This is a monthly data for passengers which fits the requirement of time series analysis. This assessment will give you insight for trend and seasonality using ACF and Boxplot. Data has been smoothened using Holtwinter method. The model created would help forcasting data points.

#It shows data series in a time series format
data("AirPassengers")
class(AirPassengers)

#Start of the time series
start(AirPassengers)

#end of the time series
end(AirPassengers)

#Cycle of 12 months in a year
frequency(AirPassengers)

#the number of passengers are distributed across the spectrum
summary(AirPassengers)

#plot for time series
plot(AirPassengers)

#this will fit in a line
abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)))

#this will print cycle across years
cycle(AirPassengers)

#this will aggregate the cycles and display a year on year trend
plot(aggregate(AirPassengers, FUN = mean))

#Box plot will give us sense of seasonal effect. In the month of August, there were highest number of passenger
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers))

#We need to make the series stationary in order to do time series analysis. Log function will help us do that.
plot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

library(tseries)

#We perform the ADF test of the logarithmically, difference time series and see if the data is now stationary.
adf.test(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

#Following is the ACF plot for the data. This may also be be used to find factors for ARMA model
acf(AirPassengers)
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

#Holt-Winters forecasting is a way to model and predict the behavior of a sequence of values over timeâ€”a time series.
